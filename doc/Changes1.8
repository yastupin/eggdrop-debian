  # RC4 release on Nov 23, 2016

  # RC2 Relased on Nov 1, 2016

    Patch by: thommey / Found by: fahuo

  - Trim version numbers from tcllib names like libtcl8.5.so.1.7.
    Patch by: thommey

  - Switch to using $CC -shared for BSD in general, this seems to work on
    newer versios, and ld -Bshareable -x fails.
    Patch by: thommey / Found by: LinaSovereign

  - Work around some incompatibilies between gnu make 3.82 and 4.x.
    Patch by: thommey / Found by: Robby

  - Fix out-of-bounds read error
    Patch by: thommey, Geo / Found by: Robby

  - Clear channel modes on disconnect
    Patch by: Geo / Found by: thommey

    nuke_server() calls reset_chan_info(), which clears channel modes and
    then re-requests them, which is the point of the function. However,
    because the server connection has already been killed, chan->status
    is set to CHAN_ASKEDBANS and thus doesn't re-request the banlist from
    the server when it finally does rejoin. By setting to clear_chan, the
    list is just cleared and the banlist properly requested from the IRC
    server on join.

  - Ensure our Makefile works with both BSD make and GNU make.
    Patch by: thommey / Found by: Geo

  - Fix formatting bug in 618ecbf9, MISC_LOGREPEAT contains a format specifier.

  - Tcl various OS linking, cross-compilation issues. Fixes #250, #251
    Patch by: thommey / Found by: eelcohuininga, thommey

    Fixes Tcl-related compilation/linking issues by using the
    tclConfig.sh variables and including -lz if Tcl >= 8.6 and we have no
    tclConfig.sh

  - Fix cygwin windows.h inclusion. Fixes #262, #265, #266
    Patch by: thommey / Found by: creatio, jackal

    Cygwin's windows.h inclusion only works if VOID is not defined, and
    we undefine their openssl defines before including the official
    openssh headers. We need to include windows.h to have FreeConsole()
    to launch eggdrop into the background properly.

  - Reset channel information on disconnect properly.
    Patch by: Cizzle

    Patch by: thommey / Found by: simply
