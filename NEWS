                                What's new?


  This file lists major and incompatible changes in Eggdrop versions.
  You can find the full list of changes in doc/Changes1.8.
  For support, feel free to visit us on Freenode #eggdrop.

  For upgrading from a pre-1.6 version of Eggdrop: Read the UPGRADING file.

  In general, always make a BACKUP of your config and user-/chanfile.

     _________________________________________________________________

Eggdrop v1.8.2:

    eggdrop.conf changes:
      - temp-path renamed to tmpfile and its purpose changed.
        It is now only used by filesys.mod/transfer.mod and optional.
      - blowfish-use-mode is a new setting for Tcl encrypt/decrypt.
        Allows using CBC instead of ECB mode for encryption.
        Tcl scripts not using the same mode are incompatible with each other.
        Does NOT affect password hashing for the userfile.
        CBC will be the NEW DEFAULT in a later version of eggdrop.
        Will be removed in a future Eggdrop version and forced to CBC.
      - global-* is renamed to default-*.
        This clarifies their purpose as default channel settings,
        not ones that override for existing channels.
        global-* still works for backwards compatibility.
    Tcl-API changes:
      - encrypt/decrypt: These commands can now encrypt/decrypt in CBC
        mode instead of the current ECB mode. This does NOT affect password
        hashing for the userfile.
      - getuser: Can now be called without a second argument. Returns a flat
        key/value list (dict) of settings for that user.
      - configureargs: New global variable holding the ./configure arguments.
        This is a _string_, not a list. User needs to split it themselves.
      - maskhost: New types 30-39 set hostmask to * (to allow e.g. nick!*@*).
    General changes:
      - Improved command line argument parsing.
      - Portuguese language file added.
      - Eggdrop no longer changes nick on every rehash if altnick uses '?'.
      - Terminal-mode (commandline -nt) always has full owner access now.
      - Allow spaces in server passwords in serverlist.

Eggdrop v1.8.1:

    Autobotchk - Added functionality improvements to the tried-and-true
      autobotchk script, allowing characters such as {} and [] to be used in
      filenames. Additionally, it can also now handle long botnetnicks for 
      pidfiles and check for additional sourced config files.

    .who linkedbot output - Truncates listings appropriately.

    eggdrop.conf - Update source code to match defaults given in Eggdrop
      configuration file.

    Minutely hook - The minutely hook was only called for missed minutes mod
      60, now it is still listed in minutes but it can be greater than 60.

    Options summary - At the end of configure, Eggdrop now displays a handy
      summary of basic options used during compile. It will display the OS
      and Tcl version found, along with if TLS, IPv6 and SSL are enabled.

    New OpenSSL version detection - A recent update to the OpenSSL libs
      rendered some of our checks invalid, particularly the hexstr2buf call.
      This is now fixed.

    Implemented version.h - Moved previously hard-coded version strings to
      version.h and update them via misc/setpatch instead of misc/addpatch.
      This also fixes inconsistencies in setting the internal version
      integer.

    Compile cleanup - Fixed some compiler warnings. 

    General bugfixes - Small code tweaks to eliminate some rare error
      conditions.

Eggdrop v1.8.0:

  MODULES

    While most 3rd party modules that worked on Eggdrop1.6.x should still work
    with Eggdrop1.8.x, many of them contain a version check that only allows
    them to run on 1.6.x bots. We have removed the version check from some of
    the more popular modules provide them at 
    ftp://eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/modules/1.8/

  SCRIPTS

    All 3rd party Tcl scripts that work with Eggdrop1.6.x fully work with
    Eggdrop1.8.x.

  ENCODINGS

    Eggdrop1.8 has been modified to support the utf-8 encoding with a fallback
    of iso8859-1. Other single-byte encodings are not yet supported, but
    full support for them is planned for a later version of Eggdrop1.8.

  IPV6

    Full IPv6 support for servers, telnet and script connections, dcc and
    botnet. See doc/IPV6 for more information.


  SSL

    Full SSL support has been added for all kinds of connections, including
    certificate verification and authorization, and partyline SSL. See doc/TLS.

  BOTNET

    Because 1.8 bots attempt to link with SSL if available everytime, make
    sure you generate a certificate on your hub bot with "make sslcert" after
    "make install".

  CONFIG

     eggdrop.conf changes:

     To ease the transition from Eggdrop1.6.x to Eggdrop1.8.0, we have created
     a list of config file changes needed at http://eggheads.org/eggconf180.txt. 
     Perhaps the most important changes are the removal of the my-ip and
     my-hostname settings, replaced by vhost4, vhost6 and the listen-addr
     setting. Check our new eggdrop.conf for examples.

     eggdrop-basic.conf:

     Eggdrop1.8.0 includes a simpler configuration file called
     eggdrop-basic.conf, which is recommended for users that do not need
     advanced Eggdrop features such as botnets. We still recommend reading the
     full eggdrop.conf and copying settings over that you might want to modify.


  WIRE REMOVED

    The wire module has been removed from eggdrop 1.8. You can still get it
    from ftp://eggheads.org/pub/eggdrop/modules/1.8/wire-2.1.tar.gz
    Note that with ssl support you can have encrypted botnet and partyline
    without wire.mod.


  DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation has been updated to reflect new and removed commands and
    variables. Almost all files have changed, so take a look at them.


  TCL COMMANDS

    A lot of changes have been made to Tcl commands. Please look at
    doc/tcl-commands.doc to see them.
