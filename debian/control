Description: Advanced IRC Robot
 Eggdrop is an IRC bot written in C, which sits on channels and takes
 protective measures, such as preventing it from being taken over (in
 the few ways that anything can), recognizing banned users to reject
 them, recognizing privileged users to give them operator status,
 punishing users for things like flooding, among innumerable others.
 .
 All of this is completely configurable, and can be disabled or enabled
 as you wish in the configuration file. Also, it's very easy to expand
 and customize with Tcl scripts and C modules, making it possible to
 adapt Eggdrop to any special need you might have.

Description: Architecture independent files for eggdrop
 This package contains all the files that eggdrop places on /usr/share.
 These files are not specific to a single processor architecture once
 the package is built, so a single package can serve all the archs
 Debian supports.
 .
 This package is not useful at all if eggdrop is not installed.
