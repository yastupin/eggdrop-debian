Comment:
  This code was more or less cloned from the ircd-hybrid 5.3 source.
  The original code was written by Otto Harkoonen and even though it
  is not entirely in synch with section 2.2 of RFC1459 in that it
  additionally defines carat as an uppercase version of tilde, it's
  what is in the servers themselves so we're going with it this way.
